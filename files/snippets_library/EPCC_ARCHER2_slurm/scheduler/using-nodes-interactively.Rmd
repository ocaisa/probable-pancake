`srun` runs a single command in the queue system and then exits.
Let's demonstrate this by running the
`hostname` command with `srun`. (We can cancel an `srun` job with `Ctrl-c`.)

```bash
`r config$host_prompt_work` srun `r config$sched$submit$options` --time=00:01:00 hostname
```
```output
nid001976
```

`srun` accepts all of the same options as `sbatch`. However, instead of specifying these in a
script, these options are specified on the command-line when starting a job.

Typically, the resulting shell environment will be the same as that for
`sbatch`.

### Interactive jobs

Sometimes, you will need a lot of resource for interactive use. Perhaps it's our first time running
an analysis or we are attempting to debug something that went wrong with a previous job.
Fortunately, SLURM makes it easy to start an interactive job with `srun`:

```bash
`r config$host_prompt_work` srun `r config$sched$submit$options` --pty /bin/bash
```

You should be presented with a bash prompt. Note that the prompt may change
to reflect your new location, in this case the compute node we are logged on.
You can also verify this with `hostname`.

When you are done with the interactive job, type `exit` to quit your session.
