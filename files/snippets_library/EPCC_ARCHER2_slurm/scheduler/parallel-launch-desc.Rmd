```bash
srun python pi-mpi.py 10000000
```

And this corresponds to the four required items we described above:

  1. Parallel launch program: in this case the parallel launch program is
     called `srun`; the additional argument controls which cores are used.
  2. Number of parallel processes per node: in this case this is 16,
     and is specified by the option `--ntasks-per-node=16` option.
  2. Total number of parallel processes: in this case this is also 16, because
     we specified 1 node and 16 parallel processes per node.
  4. Our program and arguments: in this case this is `python pi-mpi.py 10000000`.
