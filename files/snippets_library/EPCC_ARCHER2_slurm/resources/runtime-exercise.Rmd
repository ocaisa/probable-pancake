## Benchmarking the parallel performance
Modify your job script to run on multiple cores and evaluate the performance of `pi-mpi.py`
on a variety of different core counts and use multiple runs to complete a table like the one
below.
If you examine the log file you will see that it contains two timings: the total time taken by the
entire program and the time taken solely by the calculation. The calculation of Pi from the Monte-Carlo counts
is not parallelised so this is a serial overhead, performed by a single processor.
The calculation part is, in theory, perfectly parallel (each processor operates on independent sets of unique random numbers
) so this should get faster on more cores. The Calculation core seconds is the
*calculation time* multiplied by the number of cores.

| Cores      | Overall run time (s) | Calculation time (s) | Calculation core seconds |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 (serial) |                      |                      |                          |
| 2          |                      |                      |                          |
| 4          |                      |                      |                          |                    
| 8          |                      |                      |                          | 
| 16         |                      |                      |                          | 
| 32         |                      |                      |                          | 
| 64         |                      |                      |                          |              
| 128        |                      |                      |                          | 
| 256        |                      |                      |                          |

Look at your results â€“ do they make sense? Given the structure of the code, you would
expect the performance of the calculation to increase
linearly with the number of cores: this would give a roughly constant figure for the Calculation core
seconds. Is this what you observe?

::: solution

The table below shows example timings for runs on `r config$remote$name`

| Cores      | Overall run time (s) | Calculation time (s) |       Calculation core seconds |
