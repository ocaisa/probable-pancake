## Cancelling multiple jobs

We can also cancel all of our jobs at once using the `-u` option. This will
delete all jobs for a specific user (in this case, yourself). Note that you
can only delete your own jobs.

Try submitting multiple jobs and then cancelling them all.

:::: solution

## Solution

First, submit a trio of jobs:

```bash
`r config$remote$prompt` `r config$sched$submit$name` `r config$sched$submit$options` example-job.sh
`r config$remote$prompt` `r config$sched$submit$name` `r config$sched$submit$options` example-job.sh
`r config$remote$prompt` `r config$sched$submit$name` `r config$sched$submit$options` example-job.sh
```

Then, cancel them all:

```bash
`r config$remote$prompt` `r config$sched$del` -u `r config$remote$user`
```
