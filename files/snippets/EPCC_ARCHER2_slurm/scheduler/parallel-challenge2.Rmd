## Configuring parallel jobs
You will see in the job output that information is displayed about
where each MPI process is running, in particular which node it is
on.

Modify the pi-mpi-run script that you run a total of 2 nodes and 16 processes;
but to use only 8 tasks on each of two nodes.
Check the output file to ensure that you understand the job
distribution.

::: solution
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --partition=`r config$sched$partition`
#SBATCH --qos=`r config$sched$qos`
#SBATCH --time=00:00:30

#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8

module load cray-python
srun python pi-mpi.py 10000000
```
